# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: [2025-12-08 11:34]
**Context**: [ Has eyesight power Issue when looking at Screen, uses Blue light filter ]
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "Last night I used Microsoft To-do for prepping for my studies. I used the task manager to check and remember the topics I have completed and have not completed for my preparation for my exams which are coming up."

**Observations**:
- Usefulness 
- Time pressure context (deadline stress)
- Checking tasks

**Themes**: `filter_persistence`, `cognitive_load`, `deadline_anxiety`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: " There was no option for me to check and uncheck boxes for completion of tasks under Main tasks ( Sub-tasks). For example under Cardiology I could not check out Coronary Artery disease after I completed studying that particular section, this made me forget that I studied that portion and had to go through it again only to relaise later that I studied that, which made me lose my time."

**Observations**:
- Minimal options
- Forgot to check
- Loss of time

**Themes**: `status_feedback`, `confirmation`, `trust`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: " When I had many tasks to complete, I could not arrange my tasks according to Priority which made me lose my track of it and it went under the pile. Once when I had an exam and  did not have enough time to study, I wanted to study a few things, for which I wanted to stuy the main important, topics. I thought of arranging them in terms of priority but the task manager did not let me do that."

**Observations**:
- Losing track
- Prioritisation need
- Consequence = missed deadline (high impact)

**Themes**: `prioritisation`, `visibility`, `urgent_tasks`

---

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: " Yes, I mainly use a track pad because I cannot carry a mouse with me everywhere, so I use my trackpad or I use the keyboard. My trackpad stopped working one day as some oils and food items got stuck in between, so i solely relied on my keyboard. I could not easily access everything with a keyboard the way i did with a mouse. I had a specific powerpoint creation that day and I could not create and access many features and tools beacuse of just using thye keyboard."

**Observations**:
- Keyboard-only experience less movement
- Mental degradation and frustration
- Exclusion from features

**Themes**: `keyboard_nav`, `temporary_impairment`, `button_accessibility`

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: " I dont try to look at the screen with my eyes closed, but when harsh sunlights hits the screen it reflect6s back on my eyes hurting it. Plus everything has the same colour so the lines and words mixes with the background making to look blank or very hard to read which leads to straining my eyes."

**Observations**:
- Contrast issue (situational disability)
- Mixing with background
- Environmental factor (sunlight)

**Themes**: `contrast`, `zoom`, `responsive_design`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: " I would love to make my tasks colour code, with seperate tasks having seperate colours so that every task stands out making some of them already in groups by having the same colour. Also red colour can have some obvious meaning to it by making them important, yellow for important but still can take some time, green for relaxed work/ extended deadline."

**Observations**:
- Motivation through feedback
- Progress visualisation
- Weekly scope (not just daily)

**Themes**: `progress_tracking`, `motivation`, `feedback`

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Filter resets → cognitive overload
2. No confirmation feedback → uncertainty
3. Keyboard navigation gaps → temporary exclusion
4. Contrast issues in bright light → situational disability

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm filtering tasks, I want the selection to persist across page reloads so I don't lose my place."
- "When I submit a form, I want immediate confirmation so I know it worked without refreshing."
- "When my mouse breaks, I want full keyboard access so I can still complete tasks."

- Time pressure context (deadline stress)
- Tag-based workflow (not just chronological)

**Themes**: `filter_persistence`, `cognitive_load`, `deadline_anxiety`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "When I submit a form and nothing happens—like, did it save? I have to refresh the whole page to check."

**Observations**:

- Exclusion from features

**Themes**: `keyboard_nav`, `temporary_impairment`, `button_accessibility`

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "Haven't tried eyes closed, but in sunlight I can't read low-contrast text. I increase zoom but then the layout breaks."
