### Task 2: Editing a Task with Instant Feedback

**Start**: 14:52:19 → **End**: 14:53:31 = **12 seconds**

**Success**: 1

**Errors**: 0

**Confidence**: 4/5

**Observations**:

- Editing task with keyboard was easier than compared to filtering as a lot of time was lost for the participant by scrolling down using the tab keys.
- Editing was successful and it was updated in real time.
- Confirmation message was Instant but participant conveyed a huge problem, the colours of the key focus blended and mixed with the background colours making it unreadable and had to strain the eyes each time the focus was lost of the screen.

**Observations**:

- It took the most time out of the tasks currently as the Participant had to add and delete tasks just using the keyboard tab but they were successful at the end.

### Debrief Notes

**Most confusing**: "Why keyboard tabbing did not have an upwards movement when we required that."

**Most helpful**: "Colour outline of the key focus was mixed and not visible enought to navigate."

**Accessibility**: Keyboard only, ( broken mouse / non-working touchpad ) .
