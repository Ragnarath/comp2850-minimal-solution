## Task 1: Filter Tasks (Search)
- **Scenario**: You have a long list and need to find tasks related to coursework. You want to see only tasks containing the word **“report”**.
- **Action**: Use the filter/search input to filter the list by typing `report`.
- **Success**: The list updates to show only matching tasks (and you can clearly tell filtering happened, e.g., fewer items / result count / visible query).
- **Target**: **≤ 12 seconds** (expert ~6s × 2). fileciteturn3file2
- **Linked to**: **Week 6 Job Story S1 (Filter persistence / reducing cognitive load)** — `wk06/research/stories.md#S1`. fileciteturn3file9

## Task 2: Edit an Existing Task
- **Scenario**: One task has a typo that could cause you to miss a deadline. The task **“Submit invoies”** should be corrected to **“Submit invoices”**.
- **Action**: Find the task, choose the edit option, update the title, then save/confirm.
- **Success**: The updated title is shown in the list after saving (no duplicate items; no errors; change persists after a reload).
- **Target**: **≤ 20 seconds** (expert ~10s × 2). fileciteturn3file2
- **Linked to**:
  - **Week 6 Job Story S2 (Confirmation feedback)** — `wk06/research/stories.md#S2`. fileciteturn3file9
  - **Week 6 Job Story S3 (Full keyboard access)** — `wk06/research/stories.md#S3` (if edit must be reachable via keyboard). fileciteturn3file9

## Task 3: Add a New Task
- **Scenario**: You suddenly remember something important during studying: **“Call supplier about delivery”**. You need to add it quickly without losing focus.
- **Action**: Use the add-task form to add the task with title `Call supplier about delivery` and submit.
- **Success**: The new task appears in the list and you receive a clear success confirmation (visual and, where applicable, screen-reader friendly).
- **Target**: **≤ 10 seconds** (expert ~5s × 2). fileciteturn3file2
- **Linked to**:
  - **Week 6 Job Story S2 (Confirmation feedback)** — `wk06/research/stories.md#S2`. fileciteturn3file9
  - *(Optional if relevant)* **Week 6 Job Story S6 (Persistent error messages when JS is off)** — `wk06/research/stories.md#S6` (this task often triggers validation). fileciteturn3file10

## Task 4: Delete a Task (With Confirmation)
- **Scenario**: You completed an item and want to remove it to keep the list clean. Delete **“Buy milk”** (or another clearly completed task).
- **Action**: Use the delete control for that task and confirm if prompted.
- **Success**: The task is removed from the list (and you receive a clear confirmation/status message that deletion succeeded).
- **Target**: **≤ 8 seconds** (expert ~4s × 2). fileciteturn3file2
- **Linked to**: **Week 6 Job Story S2 (Confirmation feedback / status messages)** — `wk06/research/stories.md#S2`. fileciteturn3file9

## Task 5: Keyboard-Only Completion (Cross-cutting)
- **Scenario**: Your mouse/trackpad isn’t available (broken hardware, RSI flare-up, or you’re on a train). You must complete a core workflow using only the keyboard.
- **Action**: Using **Tab / Shift+Tab / Enter / Space**, complete **one** of: filter tasks, add task, edit task, or delete task.
- **Success**: The workflow completes without needing a mouse; focus order is logical; all controls are reachable and operable.
- **Target**: **≤ 15 seconds** (expert ~7s × 2; includes extra time to find focus). fileciteturn3file2
- **Linked to**: **Week 6 Job Story S3 (Full keyboard access)** — `wk06/research/stories.md#S3`. fileciteturn3file9

# Consent Script (Read Verbatim)

- Thanks for agreeing to pilot my prototype. This is a short usability test (about 15 minutes). I’ll ask you to complete **4 tasks** while I observe and take notes. I’m testing the **interface**, not you—there are no wrong answers.
- **What I will collect**: time-on-task, whether you complete each task successfully, any errors you hit, a quick confidence rating after each task, and my written observations.
- **What I will not collect**: your name, email, student ID, or any audio/video recordings.
- Your anonymous session code today is: **[P?_xxxx]**. You can ask me to delete your session data at any point later.
- You can stop the session at any time, for any reason, with no explanation needed.
- Do you have any questions?
- **Are you happy to proceed?** (Wait for a clear verbal “yes” before continuing.) fileciteturn3file19
